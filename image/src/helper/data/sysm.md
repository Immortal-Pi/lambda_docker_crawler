It will help identify potential uses and the benefits and considerations for robotic process automation. The students will learn the elements of a business process and the basics of developing a BPM application, implementing triggers to automate processes, defining and measuring KPIs. Students will use elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities to handle high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously required humans to perform. These tasks can include queries, calculations, and maintenance of records and transactions. Students will be able to use apply analytics to the generated data for a systematic computational analysis of data for the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data that will be used towards effective decision making.
